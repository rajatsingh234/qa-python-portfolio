Manual Testing, Automation Testing, and AI-assisted QA practices.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a QA Automation Engineer with experience in manual and automation
testing using Python, Selenium, API testing, and CI/CD practices.
This portfolio demonstrates how I approach testing in real-world domains.

## 📂 Domains Covered

### 🏦 Banking Domain
- Requirement analysis & test planning
- Risk-based test scenario design
- Execution-ready manual test cases

(Automation and AI testing will be added next.)

## 🧪 Testing Approach
- Test Plan → Test Scenarios → Test Cases
- Risk-based and negative testing
- Realistic enterprise documentation

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Manual Testing
- Python
- Selenium (planned)
- REST API testing (planned)
- Git & GitHub

## Purpose
I built an end-to-end banking automation project covering both UI and API layers.
For UI, I used Selenium with Pytest and Page Object Model to automate login, account overview, fund transfer, and logout, with proper synchronization and Allure reporting.
For API automation, I validated backend business logic using Python requests, handling session-based authentication, dynamically fetching customer and account IDs, and validating fund transfer operations.

## 📌 Note
All applications used are mock/demo systems created for portfolio purposes.
